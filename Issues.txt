Hello, 

I have the following situation and hopefully someone can help

Language: Python 3.8
Flight Review App : https://github.com/PX4/flight_review

Objective: Download the latest flight from the drone (using jmavsim right now)
    and send it to the installed FlightReview APP (in its own directory) automatically 
    using a python script.

Info:
FlightReview App (FR): 
Installed in its own directory. A virtual environment was not used to 
install FR. Installation instructions were followed from github page.

My Code: 
Cloned the repo, created a vevn, then installed requirements. 

Problem: 
Ran /flightlogs/__main__.py and recevied the following error: 
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "./serve.py", line 12, in <module>
        from bokeh.application import Application
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bokeh'

However, this was not an issue when My Code was not in a venv. The script would work
Bokeh module is installed, as everything in FR is working fine. 
If FR runs standalone, it works. 

What could be causing this and what are some recommendations on resolving this. 

Solution: Installed the dependencies (requirements.txt) from FlightReview App in
    the vevn of My Code
